# Anti-Bump-Sensor
A project using an Arduino UNO, LCD display, ultrasonic sensor, and LIDAR sensor.

## Project Description
This project aims to promote safe driving and avoid car collisions through the Anti-Bump Sensor. In this workshop, we explore the old features of existing cars’ sensors and incorporate new ideas to make the anti-bump sensor prototype. Our research results focus on the mapping ability of the sensor and the audio + visual alerts that are the most beneficial for the driver.
	
A variety of modern car parking sensors were made to guide parking. Amongst these types, the notable ones are cameras, radar, and Lidar. The Anti Bump sensor will require a Lidar sensor and 2 sub-components working as an alert to the driver; LCD and Speaker. Based on the communication between the driver and sensor, we can brief an outline of the best way to start off on how the anti-bump sensor will be built. We will be using a Lidar sensor to detect obstacles within certain ranges and the speaker as well as the LCD will work together to alert the driver. The “Certain Ranges” are the # divisions of the Lidar’s max range and with each range of division, the audible alerts will progressively get faster.
